		<h2>INTERESTS</h2>
		<p class="interests_p"> To be honest, I have too many interests it feels like. in my spare time I would draw on my Ipad, crochet, and read. Currently, I'm trying to work on a full-sized blanket for a gift. It has gotten to the point I can be warm while I work. Sometime in the near future I do want to play with gouache, which is a type of jelly paint. When I'm not being a creative, I do like to play video games. They vary from Genshin Impact, Valorant, Animal Crossing, Lethal Company and every other cozy game out there.
