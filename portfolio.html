						For this postcard, I drew inspiration from a childhood memory. Our class brainstormed a word to
						base
						off
						our theme to the postcard. Our word became evolve. My first thought was how technology has
						evolved.
						A
						classmate mentioned how theirs reminded them of a childhood memory. Instantly, I thought of how
						me
						and
						my family would launch rockets at my grandparents’ house. I made a new connection with
						technology
						that
						felt fitting and personal. The inspiration for the illustration style was NASA posters and how
						me
						and
						dad would paint rockets together.

		After identifying a local issue, we were to communicate, educate and share thoughts and ideas with an audience
		through our work. In this project, I chose to create an infographic on illiteracy, then researched facts and
		statistics to add to my infographic. After researching, we were to translate that into a color system, graphs,
		icons, and illustrations. This was to inform the viewer how illiteracy is affecting our future generations.

		In this project, we had to select any product from any department in a store. Through illustration only, we were
		to show the steps involved to make the product to being on the store shelves. The idea was to make this
		informative and fun for the viewer. The typefaces were chosen to mimick what some coffee shops might use on
		their posters.

		One of my many interests has been Korean music, also known as K-pop. For my independent project, I chose a solo
		artist and designed her album to be illustration-based rather than photography based. K-pop albums normally
		include a photobook including the lyrics, photocards and sometimes stickers and bookmarks. The puppy drawn in
		the illustration is I.U.’s puppy. Lilac is about reflecting on your youth. The thoughts through this album were
		bright, playful, and childlike. I decided to turn this album into a fun photoshoot for the dog based on the
		songs.

		Expressive type is an art form that can become the image. The goal was to design a book that the entire song’s
		lyrics were emphasized with expressive type. The colors reflect the calmness of the song. The rings throughout
		the booklet are periods and O’s. It was to show the waves I felt through the song, from it feeling serene to a
		rollercoaster ride. The moods throughout this song had to be expressed though objective visuals.
